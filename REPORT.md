## üè• Problem Statement

### Background
Chest X-rays are one of the most widely used and cost-effective diagnostic tools in medicine, yet interpreting them requires significant time, expertise, and attention from radiologists. Limited access to expert radiologists can delay diagnosis and treatment, especially in under-resourced areas.

### Challenge
Develop an automated system capable of detecting multiple thoracic diseases from chest X-ray images to:
- **Assist radiologists** by providing faster preliminary screenings
- **Reduce diagnostic burden** in resource-constrained settings
- **Provide consistent analysis** across different medical facilities
- **Prioritize critical cases** for urgent review

### Target Diseases
The system detects 7 thoracic conditions:
1. **Cardiomegaly** - Enlarged heart
2. **Edema** - Fluid accumulation in lungs
3. **Emphysema** - Lung tissue damage
4. **Hernia** - Organ displacement
5. **Pneumonia** - Lung infection
6. **Fibrosis** - Lung scarring
7. **Pneumothorax** - Collapsed lung

## üî¨ Methodology: A Three-Phase Journey

## Phase 1: Traditional Machine Learning with Computer Vision

### Approach Overview
Our first approach used classical computer vision techniques combining:
- **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)** for keypoint detection
- **Bag of Visual Words (BoVW)** for feature representation
- **TF-IDF weighting** for feature importance
- **Traditional ML classifiers** (Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost)

### Step 1: SIFT Feature Extraction

**What is SIFT?**
SIFT detects and describes local features in images that are invariant to scale, rotation, and illumination changes.

**Process:**
```python
# Extracted SIFT descriptors from each X-ray
- Keypoint detection across multiple scales
- 128-dimensional feature vectors per keypoint
- Average ~200-300 keypoints per chest X-ray
```

**Challenges:**
- Variable number of keypoints per image (100-500 range)
- High dimensional feature space (128 dimensions per keypoint)
- Need for fixed-size representation for ML models

### Step 2: Building the Visual Vocabulary

**Bag of Visual Words (BoVW):**
```
1. Collect all SIFT descriptors from training images
   ‚Üí Result: Millions of 128-D feature vectors

2. Apply K-Means clustering to create "visual words"
   ‚Üí Codebook size: 500 clusters
   ‚Üí Each cluster represents a visual pattern

3. Convert each image to histogram of visual words
   ‚Üí Count frequency of each visual word in image
   ‚Üí Result: 500-dimensional feature vector per image
```

**Codebook Creation:**
- **K-Means clustering** with k=500
- **Convergence criterion:** 100 iterations or <0.001 change
- **Training time:** ~2 hours on CPU

### Step 3: TF-IDF Weighting

Applied Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency weighting:

```
TF-IDF(word, image) = TF(word, image) √ó IDF(word)

where:
  TF = Frequency of visual word in image
  IDF = log(Total images / Images containing word)
```

**Purpose:** Reduce impact of common visual patterns, emphasize discriminative features.

### Step 4: Baseline Model Training

Trained independent binary classifiers for each disease:

#### Logistic Regression (Baseline)
```
Configuration:
- Solver: lbfgs
- Max iterations: 1000
- Class weight: balanced (to handle imbalance)
- Regularization: L2 (default)
```

#### Support Vector Machine (Baseline)
```
Configuration:
- Kernel: RBF (Radial Basis Function)
- C: 1.0
- Gamma: scale
- Class weight: balanced
```

#### XGBoost (Baseline)
```
Configuration:
- Max depth: 3
- Learning rate: 0.1
- n_estimators: 100
- Scale_pos_weight: Calculated per disease
```

### Phase 1 Results: Traditional ML

| Disease | LR (AUC) | SVM (AUC) | XGBoost (AUC) | Best Model |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **Cardiomegaly** | 0.569 | 0.430 | 0.481 | Logistic Regression |
| **Edema** | 0.808 | **0.810** | 0.784 | SVM |
| **Emphysema** | 0.623 | 0.382 | 0.554 | Logistic Regression |
| **Hernia** | 0.698 | 0.715 | **0.848** | XGBoost |
| **Pneumonia** | 0.641 | **0.644** | 0.625 | SVM |
| **Fibrosis** | 0.545 | 0.452 | 0.402 | Logistic Regression |
| **Pneumothorax** | 0.684 | 0.316 | 0.619 | Logistic Regression |
| **Average** | **0.653** | 0.534 | 0.616 | - |

### Phase 1 Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Hernia detection performed well (0.848 AUC with XGBoost)
- ‚úÖ Edema showed promise (0.810 AUC)
- ‚úÖ Fast inference time (~50ms per image)
- ‚úÖ Interpretable features (visual words)

**Limitations:**
- ‚ùå Suboptimal performance on most diseases (AUC < 0.70)
- ‚ùå SIFT may miss subtle radiological patterns
- ‚ùå BoVW loses spatial information
- ‚ùå Feature engineering bottleneck
- ‚ùå Cardiomegaly detection especially poor (0.569 AUC)

**Decision:** Results were **not clinically satisfactory** (target: AUC > 0.80). Needed to explore deep learning approaches.

## Phase 2: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN from Scratch)

### Motivation
Traditional ML struggled to capture complex visual patterns in chest X-rays. CNNs can:
- Automatically learn hierarchical features
- Preserve spatial information
- Detect subtle patterns humans might miss

### Architecture Design

**Custom CNN Architecture:**
```python
CustomCNN(
  # Block 1: Initial feature extraction
  Conv2d(3, 32, kernel=3) ‚Üí BatchNorm ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí MaxPool
  
  # Block 2: Deeper features
  Conv2d(32, 64, kernel=3) ‚Üí BatchNorm ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí MaxPool
  
  # Block 3: Complex patterns
  Conv2d(64, 128, kernel=3) ‚Üí BatchNorm ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí MaxPool
  
  # Block 4: High-level features
  Conv2d(128, 256, kernel=3) ‚Üí BatchNorm ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí MaxPool
  
  # Classifier
  GlobalAvgPooling ‚Üí FC(256, 128) ‚Üí Dropout(0.5) ‚Üí FC(128, 7)
)

Total Parameters: ~2.5M
```

**Training Configuration:**
```
Input size: 224√ó224 RGB
Batch size: 32
Optimizer: Adam (lr=0.001)
Loss: BCEWithLogitsLoss
Epochs: 50 (with early stopping)
Data augmentation:
  - Random horizontal flip
  - Random rotation (¬±10¬∞)
  - Color jitter
  - Random affine transforms
```

### Phase 2 Results: Custom CNN

**Training Challenges:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slow convergence (10+ hours on GPU)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Validation AUC plateaued around 0.65-0.70
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Overfitting despite dropout and regularization
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Inconsistent performance across diseases

**Approximate Results:**
```
Average AUC: ~0.68 (validation)
Best individual: Pneumothorax (0.74)
Worst: Fibrosis (0.58)
```

### Phase 2 Analysis

**Why did custom CNN underperform?**

1. **Limited Training Data**
   - 78,500 images insufficient for training CNN from scratch
   - Medical imaging requires 100K+ images per class ideally

2. **Class Imbalance**
   - Rare diseases (Hernia: 0.2%) had insufficient samples
   - Model biased toward "No Finding" class

3. **Lack of Medical Domain Knowledge**
   - Random initialization doesn't know what chest X-rays look like
   - Missing anatomical priors

4. **Training Instability**
   - Gradient issues in deeper layers
   - Difficulty learning subtle radiological features

**Decision:** Custom CNN showed improvement over traditional ML but still fell short of clinical requirements. **Needed pre-trained models with transfer learning.**

### Model Selection: DenseNet-121

**Why DenseNet over ResNet or VGG?**

**DenseNet Advantages:**
1. **Dense Connectivity:** Each layer receives input from all previous layers
   - Better gradient flow
   - Feature reuse
   - Reduced parameters (7.9M vs ResNet-50's 25M)

2. **Medical Imaging Success:** State-of-the-art on CheXNet benchmark
   
3. **Efficient Feature Propagation:** Critical for subtle disease patterns

**Architecture:**
```python
DenseNet121 (Pre-trained on ImageNet)

```

### Training Strategy

**Fine-tuning Approach:**
```python
# 1. Load pre-trained DenseNet-121
model = models.densenet121(pretrained=True)

# 2. Replace final classifier
model.classifier = nn.Linear(1024, 7)  # 7 diseases

# 3. Fine-tune entire network
# (No frozen layers - full end-to-end training)
```

## üß† Model Interpretability: Grad-CAM

### What is Grad-CAM?

**Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping** visualizes which regions of an X-ray the model focuses on when making predictions.

**How it works:**
```
1. Forward pass: Generate predictions
2. Backward pass: Compute gradients of target class w.r.t. feature maps
3. Weight feature maps by gradients
4. Generate heatmap showing important regions
5. Overlay heatmap on original image
```

### Clinical Validation

- ‚úÖ Model focuses on heart borders and cardiothoracic ratio
- ‚úÖ Aligns with radiologist's diagnosis criteria

**Pneumonia Detection:**
- ‚úÖ Highlights infiltrates and consolidations in lung fields
- ‚úÖ Correctly identifies affected lobes

**Pneumothorax Detection:**
- ‚úÖ Focuses on pleural spaces and lung periphery
- ‚úÖ Detects collapsed lung regions

**Edema Detection:**
- ‚úÖ Highlights bilateral pulmonary congestion patterns
- ‚úÖ Identifies Kerley B lines and vascular redistribution

### Grad-CAM Implementation

```python
class GradCAM:
    def __init__(self, model, target_layer):
        # Register hooks to capture activations and gradients
        self.model = model
        self.target_layer = target_layer
    
    def generate_cam(self, input_image, target_class):
        # Forward pass
        output = self.model(input_image)
        
        # Backward pass
        self.model.zero_grad()
        output[0, target_class].backward()
        
        # Weight activations by gradients
        weights = self.gradients.mean(dim=[2, 3])
        cam = (weights[:, :, None, None] * self.activations).sum(1)
        
        # Apply ReLU and normalize
        cam = F.relu(cam)
        cam = cam / cam.max()
        
        return cam
